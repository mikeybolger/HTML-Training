	<h1>Hello Moon</h1>

	<p>The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. 
	It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites 
	relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, 
	the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.</p>
	<p>The average distance of the Moon from the Earth is 384,400 km (238,900 mi),[10][11] or 1.28 light-seconds.</p>
	<p>The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are several 
	hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left 
	over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>
	<p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face, with its near side marked by 
	dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent 
	impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun, 
	as measured by illuminance on Earth's surface. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night 
	sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence 
	in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an important cultural influence since ancient times 
	on language, calendars, art, mythology, and, it is often speculated, the menstrual cycles of the female of the 
	human species.</p>
	<p>The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day. 
	The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, with its apparent size in the sky 
	almost the same as that of the Sun, resulting in the Moon covering the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. 
	This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future. The Moon's linear distance from Earth is 
	currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres (1.504 ± 0.028 in) per year, but this rate is not constant.</p>
	<p>The Soviet Union's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; the United 
	States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only crewed missions to date, beginning with the first crewed lunar 
	orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six crewed lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being 
	Apollo 11. These missions returned over 380 kg (840 lb) of lunar rocks, which have been used to develop a geological 
	understanding of the Moon's origin, the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent history. Since the 
	Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited only by uncrewed spacecraft.</p>
